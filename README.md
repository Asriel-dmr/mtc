MTC - Multi threaded compression 
will be a compression program that will be written in rust with huffman coding.
the compression will be done using multipie threads, thereby making the compression proccess easier.
the decompression will not be using threads since so far i am unable to use threads with decompression due to the way
that the huffman coding protocol works.
